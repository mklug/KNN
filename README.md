# KNN

Simple implementation of [K-nearest neighbors classifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm).  The file ``KNN.py`` contains the implementation and the file ``test.ipynb`` contains a demo together with a comparison with the [sklearn implementation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier.html) on the [Iris data set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set).
